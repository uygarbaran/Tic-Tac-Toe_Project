# Tic-Tac-Toe_Project
Step-by-step instructions for a Tic_Tac_Toe game designed with TI's MSP-EXP430FR6989 LaunchPad and BOOSTXL-EDUMKII BoosterPack. It features human vs. human & human vs. computer modes along with game board resizing & repositioning features. Here are the links to buy the boards:

Please download Code Composer Studio for this project. I used version 10.1.0, so I would recommend downloading that version or any version after that.

The complete code is private for educational purposes. Feel free to reach out to me at uygarubaran@gmail.com for any questions/improvement ideas regarding the project. Good luck and have fun!
